SELECT f1.X, f1.Y 
FROM Functions f1
INNER JOIN Functions f2 
ON f1.X=f2.Y AND f1.Y=f2.X
GROUP BY f1.X, f1.Y
HAVING COUNT(f1.X)>1 or f1.X<f1.Y
ORDER BY f1.X 


The 'count(f1.x) > 1' requires there to be at least two records of a mirrored pair to be pulled through. Without this a pair would simply match with itself (since it's already it's own mirrored pair) and be pulled through incorrectly when you join the table on itself.

The 2nd part matches the remaining mirrored pairs. It's important to note that for this challenge, the mirrored match of (f1.x,f1.y) is considered a duplicate and excluded from the final output. You can see this in the sample output where (20, 21) is outputted, but not (21,20). The 'or f1.x < f1.y' criteria allows us to pull all those pairs where f1.x does not equal f1.y, but where f1.x is also less than f1.y so we don't end up with the mirrored paired duplicate.
